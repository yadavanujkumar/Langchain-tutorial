# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with the LangChain tutorial in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yadavanujkumar/Langchain-tutorial.git
cd Langchain-tutorial

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Configure API Key

1. Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Example

```bash
python examples/01_simple_llm_chain.py
```

Expected output:
- The script will ask questions to the LLM
- You'll see responses generated by the language model
- Learn how prompt templates work

## Next Steps

Try the examples in order:
1. **01_simple_llm_chain.py** - Learn basics of LLM chains
2. **02_chat_with_memory.py** - Add conversation memory
3. **03_rag_example.py** - Build a document Q&A system
4. **04_agent_with_tools.py** - Create an intelligent agent

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"
- Make sure you created the `.env` file
- Verify the API key is correct
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the project root directory

### Error: "Module not found"
- Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### API Rate Limits
- OpenAI has rate limits for API usage
- If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan for higher limits

## Cost Considerations

- These examples use OpenAI's API which has costs
- Each example typically costs less than $0.10 to run
- Monitor your usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## Learning Path

1. **Week 1**: Run all examples and understand the basics
2. **Week 2**: Modify the examples with your own prompts and data
3. **Week 3**: Build your own small project combining concepts
4. **Week 4**: Explore advanced LangChain features in the documentation
